## About Me:

I am a final year Data science grad at Unversity at Buffalo, passionate about the intersection of data and storytelling. I'm an experienced data scientist specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. With a knack for turning complex datasets into compelling narratives through visualizations and solving real world problems, I excel in Python and SQL for robust ETL processes. My specialty involves extracting actionable insights from complex data sets and enriching AI models with advanced understanding of deep learning principles. Through my GitHub repositories, I chronicle my progression from raw data exploration to refined model analysis, reflecting a commitment to innovative solutions and strategic data narrative building.
